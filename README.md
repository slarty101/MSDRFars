Coursera: Mastering Software Development in R - Building R Packages - Week 4 Assignment

Install the latest version of this package by entering the following in R:
* install.packages("devtools")
* library(devtools)
* install_github("slarty101/MSDRFars")

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slarty101/MSDRFars.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slarty101/MSDRFars)

Notes:
* I've spent about 3 days trying to get the vignette to work properly without any joy.
* This issue seems to be related to the fact that I'm trying to include the data files to run the functions.
