# MSDRFars
Coursera: Mastering Software Development in R - Building R Packages - Week 4 Assignment

Install the latest version of this package by entering the following in R:
* install.packages("devtools")
* library(devtools)
* install_github("slarty101/MSDRFars")

Notes:
* I've spent about 3 days trying to get the vignette to work properly without joy.
* There's a parse error when I check the build on Travis in a file called 'MSDRFars_Ex.R' which seems to be an unsaved temp file so no badge.
* Both of these issues seem to be realted to the fact thatI'm trying to include the data to run the functions.
